-- Categorical definition of isomorphisms, parametrised by an underlying category.
-- Isomorphic objects form a setoid and are amenable to equational reasoning.
-- It is proved here that terminal objects are isomorphic.
-- A predicate saying that a morphism is part of an isomorphism is also provided.
