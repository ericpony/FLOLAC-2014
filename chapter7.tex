\todo[inline]{type computation --- easy one like upgrades, swaps and more intricate one relying on universe construction; computational formalism --- examples: ornaments, universal property of pullbacks; non-examples: relational calculus}

\todo[inline]{fibred category theory for unifying similar categorical constructions; measure of representational efficiency; impact of homotopy type theory (e.g., functor equality); future of internalism (highly structural; scalability might lie in, e.g., hierarchical typing); notational support and automation (e.g., \citet{Devriese-instance-arguments})}
