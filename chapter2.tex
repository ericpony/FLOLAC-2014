\chapter{From intuitionistic type theory to dependently typed programming}
\label{chapter:background}

We start with an introduction to intuitionistic type theory \citep{ML-ITT} and dependently typed programming~\citep{Altenkirch-why-dependent-types-matter, McBride-Epigram} using the Agda language \citep{Norell-thesis, Norell-Agda, Bove-dependent-types-at-work}.
Intuitionistic type theory was developed by Martin-LÃ¶f to serve as a foundation of intuitionistic mathematics like Bishop's renowned work on constructive analysis \citep{Bishop-analysis}.
While originated from intuitionistic type theory, dependently typed programming is more concerned with mechanisation and practicalities, and is influenced by the program construction movement.
It has thus departed from the mathematical traditions considerably, and deviations can be found from syntactic presentations to the underlying philosophy.

data Nat : Set where
  zero  :  Nat
  suc   :  Nat -> Nat
\end{code}
